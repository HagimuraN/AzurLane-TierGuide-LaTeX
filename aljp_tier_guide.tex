\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Evaluation Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ships are tiered by their PvE PERFORMANCE first and foremost, but notes on notable PvP usage will be made if suitable.
\item Ships are tiered according to their ability to act as a STAND-ALONE UNIT; if a unit performs better in a specific composition or if certain conditions are met, it will be noted with a second tier mark.
\item Ships are compared to others in their OWN CLASS for tiering purposes; if two ships are have comparable stats and purpose, the least expensive one will be ranked higher.
\item Ships in a tier are listed alphabetically and in order of nationality (USS -> HMS -> IJN -> KMS).
\item All skill values mentioned are at MAX level.
\item Auto performance is NOT taken into consideration. (AI is dumb and ships with more/better guns outperform the rest.)
\item PR ships and Submarines will NOT be tiered until more data on their live, peak performance is collected. This will take a while, folks.
\end{itemize}
 

\subsection{Tier Explanations}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3} % increase space between table rows
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}lX}
    Tier 0               & The absolute best in their class and beyond. Pretty much auto-includes.\\
    Tier 1               & Outstanding ships in their class. Not quite auto-includes, but have very good cause to be used.\\
    Tier 1.5             & Very good ships in their class, either by virtue of their stats or their skills.\\
    Tier 2               & Good ships in their class, either overshadowed by their higher tier competitors or by fulfilling more specific niches.\\
    Not Tiered		 & Ships that range from 'usable' to 'worthless garbage', but in both cases not good enough to make it on the list.\\
    Pro Team Players     & Ships that, while unremarkable on their own, become exceedingly good when deployed with each other. They are tiered as a single unit.\\
    Honorable Mentions   & Ships with specific niche uses they excel at.

\section[DD]{DD (Destroyer, blue torpedo icon)}

\subsection{Tier 0}
\entry{USS Laffey Kai}[LaffeyKai.png]
{5\% activation upon firing, increases own FP, Reload, and Evasion by 40\% for 8s; every 20 seconds, has a 70\% chance to active Vanquish Mode, increasing own Reload stat by 200\% for 10 seconds and releasing a powerful barrage.}
{Vorpal Bunny}
{While pretty good to begin with, once Kai'd Laffey truly stands out thanks to CL-tier Firepower and Efficiency coupled with absurd amounts of Reload, allowing her to akimbo gun down any fool standing in her way. Her torpedoes also come out much quicker than anyone else's, but given the lacking nature of US torps spamming them is one of the few ways to keep them relevant. The DPS monster to AyaKai's DPH.}

\entry{IJN Ayanami Kai}[AyanamiKai.png]
{5\% chance on firing main gun to boost Torpedo by 60\% for 8s; 70\% chance every 20s to fire a special barrage and boost Evasion stat by 30\% for 5s}
{Nuclear Launch Detected}
{Ayanami is the last word in Torp Damage - with her skill procced, the damage she can inflict with them is completely unrivaled and, with enough buff stacking, can even exceed the tens of thousands. 
On the flip side, Torpedoes are all she's got and once she's blown her load, she won't have much to do except waiting for them to come back online. The DPH monster to LafKai's DPS.}
 
\entry{IJN Yukikaze}[Yukikaze.png]
{While alive in fleet, reduce damage received by the backline by 8\% and, once per battle, when any ship in the backline drops below 20\% health, said ship is healed by 10\%; 25\% chance to activate when taking damage, said damage is decreased to 1.}
{She protecc, she attacc, but most importantly, she tsun catt.}
{Nowhere as devastating as her tier companions (or a good few other IJN DDs for that matter), she is nonetheless quite powerful and has incredible defensive skills for both herself and the backline. Also, her barrage gets a few torps thrown into it for good measure.}
 
\entry{KMS Z23 Kai}[Z23Kai.png]
{5\% chance on firing main gun to boost Firepower by 60\% for 8s; Every 20 seconds, has a 40\% (70\%) chance to active Destruction Mode, releasing a powerful barrage and spawning 2 rotating shields that can block 5 enemy shells each, and for 10 seconds own main gun critical rate becomes 100\%.\\\textbf{Special:}\\ Can equip CL guns.}
{Gun Fuhrer.}
{Z23 takes the opposite approach to Ayanami, in that she goes all in on guns - her base FP is unmatched among DDs and her skills further ehnance her gun DPS to obscene degrees, while also having great uptime.
Torps are even more of an afterthought than they are on Laffey, however, and unlike Laffey she can't make up for it by simply spamming them; she will punch ship-sized holes in Light and Medium Armour, but she'll find herself a little stumped against Heavy.}


\newpage
\subsection{Tier 1}

\entry{USS Nicholas Kai}[NicholasKai.png]
{5\% chance upon firing to increase own evasion stat by 40\% and decrease own air damage received by 40\% for 8 seconds; 60\% chance every 20s to increase own FP by 40\% for 10s; 70\% chance every 20s to increase Firepower, Torpedo, and Reload by 40\% for 10s and, once per battle, if an escort ship's Health falls below 20\%, decrease the damage it takes by 15\%. If the ship is Helena, additionally heal 8\% of Helena's max Health. }
{Sleepy Loli do it Better}
{Nicholas is a rarity among destroyers, in that she boasts both enough Firepower to face off with the best in her class and very solid defensive capabilities; a true generalist, even more so than Laffey considering her actually good torpedoes.
With no real weakness on display, beyond simply not being quite as good as more specialised units, Nicholas is a worthy addition in pretty much any escort fleet - especially one with Helena or Fletcher.}

\entry{Poi (IJN Yuudachi)}[Yuudachi.png]
{6\% chance on firing main gun to boost Firepower, Torpedo, RoF, and Evasion by 40\% for 8s}
{Poi?}
{Poi was the best of the best for a simple reason. Superior stat spread compared with an all-rounder skill that pretty much boosts EVERYTHING worth boosting on a DD. The general strat is to gear her with a super-fast DD gun to proc her skill as often as possible.}

\entry{IJN Kawakaze}[Kawakaze.png]
{Increases allied IJN DDs' damage against CL/CA by 15\%; Torpedo damage ignores enemies' armor type, always dealing 115\% against enemies.}
{}
{A turncoat of a DD, purpose-built to annihilate Light(er) Armour(ed) ships and help her allies do the same; against her targets of choice, she WILL outperform Ayanami Kai. Somewhat similar barrage to Poi's, though her torps are linear and the bullet pattern ends in a fan.}

\entry{IJN Kagerou Kai}[KagerouKai.png]
{15\% boost of torpedo stat to the frontline; 30\% chance to launch a second salvo on torpedo launch; 25\% chance to trigger every 20s, lower an enemy's Reload and Damage for 10s (targets humanoid ships first).}
{}
{Widely available early on and blessed with both excellent skills and a very solid statline, Kagerou has a place in every torp-heavy frontline (torp-CA in particular, as they typically do not have access to torpedo buffs). Her Kai is more of a slight upgrade than a massive change, with her skill being middling at best, but the extra stats are appreciated nonetheless.}

\entry{IJN Shiranui Kai}[ShiranuiKai.png]
{30\% chance to launch a second salvo on torpedo launch; when alive in fleet, reduce damage taken by allied CV/L by 15\%. Does not stack with the same skill. }
{}
{Ah, the wonders of Kai. Shiranui goes from an excellent 0LB DD meme to a supremely legit pick for normal play, owing to her much improved torp stat and efficiency. The CV/L protection skill is nice to have, too.}

\entry{KMS Z46}[Z46.png]
{Whenever enemy planes are shot down within own AA range, increase FP by 15\% of own total AA stat (Only base stat and gear is counted) and if skill procs again during its duration, it refreshes the buff; increases AP damage by 25\%}
{KMSan Diego}
{Admittedly not quite as good as an AA boat, but fulfils a similar purpose while being much more competetent at everything else - survivability, damage output, barrage, even ASW.
That said, the fact one of her skills is completely useless whenever planes aren't around does hamper her usability somewhat, but she remains a very solid DD regardless.}
 
\entry{FFNF Le Triomphant}[Le_Triomphant.png]
{When main gun damages the same target, gain up to four +40\% Reload stacks. A stack can be gained once every second, and if Le Triomphant switches target she loses the stacks; when sortied as the Lead Ship, own main gun efficiency is increased by 20\% and anti-air gun efficiency is decreased by 30\%. }
{}
{Apparently the French were into dakka. Who knew?
A gun-focused DD blessed with an excellent statline where it counts the most and an impressive barrage to go along with it, Letri is slightly unwieldy - but undeniably devastating, if allowed to stack up and lead the charge. Handle with care, and the guns of the revolution will never fall silent.
Similarly to Laffey, her torps are awful but come out quick; consider patching up this weakness with an Oxygen Torpedo.}

 
\newpage
\subsection{Tier 1.5}
\entry{HMS Javelin Kai}[JavelinKai.png]
{5\% chance on firing main gun to boost Evasion by 60\% for 8s; 70\% chance every 20s to fire a special barrage and boost torpedo stat by 30\% for 5s}
{}
{While her starter version is pretty much undeniably the worst out of the three, the Kai does her some justice. Still nowhere as powerful as Ayanami or Laffey, but the EX barrage helps to close the gap while her Evasion is and remains the absolute best in the game.}
 
\entry{Bucky (IJN Fubuki)}[Fubuki.png]
{In battle, increases evasion by 30\% and torpedo stat by 10\% of all Tokugata (herself, Ayanami, Akatsuki, Ikazuchi, Inazuma) destroyers in same fleet.}
{}
{The best buddy Ayanami will ever have, and she's damn good on her own too owing to her very high Evasion and Torpedo stat.}

\entry{IJN Tanikaze Kai}[TanikazeKai.png]
{When only escort ship alive, increase own evasion by 10\% and reduce damage taken from airstrike to self by 50\%; When her torpedo hits an enemy, 17\% chance to make said enemy take 40\% more damage from all torpedoes for 8s.}
{}
{Tinykaze sacrifices almost every part of her statline for exceptionally powerful torpedoes and a torpedo-boosting debuff.\\
Devastating if the stars align and the debuff procs on her first torp hit, but little more than a dead weight while she's stuck reloading. Handle with care.}

\entry{IJN Kuroshio/Oyashio}[Kuroshio_Oyashio.png]
{30\% chance to launch a second salvo on Torpedo launch; every 20s, 60\% chance to boost Firepower by 40\%.\\
Mikasa Event construction}
{}
{Kagerou's sisters with practically identical stats and the same double-launch skill. The firepower skill is kinda irrelevant, but that's not what you're using them for anyway.}

\entry{KMS Z25}[Z25.png]
{60\% activation every 20s, increases own FP by 40\% for 10s; reduces the damage taken by the Flagship by 25\%; can equip CL guns.\\
\textbf{Special:}\\ Can equip CL guns.}
{}
{Best of the three ships with the Flagship Protection skill, not only does she have powerful guns and high HP for her class but she also synergises beautifully with her intended protégé, Graf Zeppelin - who can protect her right back. That said, if you have no need for such a skill you should probably look for another ship.}

\entry{KMS Z35 (T1 with Z1)}[Z35.png]
{70\% activation every 20s, increase firepower by 50\% and Reload by 200\% for 10s; upon expiration, decrease reload by 100\% for 3s.\\
KMS Rerun event craft and drop}
{Vorpal Häschen}
{Z35 takes a page from Laffey's book and kicks her guns into overdrive, putting them to similar effect (and wrekcing them in the process for a few seconds). Very similar in behaviour to her USS counterpart, but whereas she can run a one-bunny show thanks to her Kai statline and skills, Z35 needs Z1's presence to really compare; and while this might sound bad, the fact she can give the best starter in the game a run for her money is worthy of recognition in its own right.}


\newpage
\subsection{Tier 2}
\entry{USS Eldridge}[Eldridge.png]
{Upon taking damage, 15\% chance to make entire escort fleet to evade all attacks for 10s. DoT and Ramming damage still apply. Cannot proc before 20s have passed (skill starts on cooldown).\\
PVP Shop only}
{}
{Slippery little bastard, despite her CA-like movement speed. Her offensive stats are somewhat lacklustre, but she makes up for it with her skill - it might be RNG and her high Evasion works against it, but 10s of invulnerability is nothing to scoff at. Make sure to have her eat weak shots to minimise exposure to danger.}
 
\entry{USS Charles Ausburne (T1.5 if deployed with CA)}[Charles_Ausburne.png]
{4\% activation upon firing, increases Fleet movement speed, and Escort evasion by 40\% for 8s; 60\% activation every 20s, increases own FP by 40\% for 10s.}
{}
{Another slippery little bastard, obsessed with justice and GOING FAST. Her torps are fairly worthless, but her guns are decent and her skill is absolutely amazing - not only does she increase your whole frontline's survivability, she also fixes whatever movement issues you might have at hand. The best DD friend your CAs could ever have.}
 
\entry{USS Maury}[Maury.png]
{40\% chance every 10s to raise evasion by 60\% for 8s; 30\% chance to launch a second salvo on torpedo launch}
{}
{Another DD with double-launch skill, always useful to have. The quick-firing Evasion skill is also fairly welcome.}
 
\entry{USS Cassin / Downes Kai}[CassinKai_DownesKai.png]
{When HP falls under 20\%, heals 25\% of max HP once per battle; 60\% chance to activate every 20 seconds, increase own Reload by 40\% for 10 seconds.}
{The DDs that would not die}
{Packing a lot of Firepower for destroyers and blessed with two very desirable skills, Cassin and Downes may not have the monstrous damage output of their IJN counterparts but they can and will outlast them many times over.}
 
\entry{HMS Ardent Kai (T1.5 if deployed with CV/L)}[ArdentKai.png]
{When alive in fleet, reduce damage taken by allied CV/L by 15\%; 25\% chance to trigger every 20 seconds, lower an enemy's Reload and Damage for 10s, prioritizing elite (human-form) enemies; when in fleet, increase CV/L airstrike damage by 15\%.}
{}
{Your carriers' new best friend. While her statline is typically HMS (ie. low HP, okay guns, good torps, high Evasion), it's hard to turn down those carrier buffs and, with some skillful play or healing support, she's well capable of holding on her own.}

\entry{IJN Yoizuki/Harutsuki}[Yoizuki_Harutsuki.png]
{For 8 seconds, whenever enemy planes are shot down within own AA range, increase firepower and AA by 25\%.}
{}
{New-and-improved Niizukis, now with half the clothing, one third more firepower and a better AA skill. While DDs aren't particularly great at AA, they do get Main Gun +1 and their skill actively encourages hunting those planes down. Solid even when planes aren't around, better when there are.}

\entry{IJN Shigure}[Shigure.png]
{5\% chance on firing main gun to boost Evasion by 60\% for 8s}
{}
{Think Javelin before her Kai, except not terrible. Excellent stats, good skill, pretty good to use overall.}
 
\entry{KMS Z1 (Tier 1.5 if running full Z-series setup)}[Z1.png]
{Increases Firepower and Evasion of Z-series ships by 40\%.}
{}
{Z1's main use is for running the Z-class destroyer trio, where she provides a MASSIVE boost to her sisters. She herself is a pretty normal torpedo-focused DD statwise.}
\vspace{10em}
 
\newpage
\subsection{ Pro Team Players}

\entry{PRAN Anshan, Changchun, Fushun or Taiyuan (T1.5)}[Anshan_Changchun_Fushun_Taiyuan.png]
{\textbf{Anshan:}\\
    while in combat, Anshan-class (all PRAN) ships have increased Accuracy, Firepower by 25\% and evasion by 10\%.\\
    \textbf{Changchun:}\\
    Increases Firepower, Reload and Accuracy by 12\% for all North Union and Eastern Radiance (ROC, PRAN) ships in fleet.\\
    \textbf{Fushun:}\\
    increase own main gun's critical rate by 20\%.\\
    \textbf{Taiyan:}\\
    while in combat with 6 ships in the fleet, increase own Firepower and Reload by 25\%, and evasion by 10\%.}
{When just one Laffey Kai isn't enough}
{This pack of cleverly disguised Gunboat CL possesses a staggering amount of Firepower and Reload for its class as well as somewhat higher HP, but it does so at the expense of their now almost worthless torpedoes.\\
Use Fushun if you don't want to pony up for a full fleet: her DPS won't be as stable as Taiyuan's, but she won't be far off and you'll be burning a lot less Oil.}

\entry{HMS Crescent Kai, Comet Kai, Cygnet Kai (T2)}[CrescentKai_CometKai_CygnetKai.png]
{\textbf{Crescent:}\\
30\% activation every 20 seconds, evade all incoming attacks for 6 seconds; deploys a smokescreen (+40\% Evasion Rate for ships inside the smoke) for 5s at the beginning of the battle and every 15s after that at a 30\% chance. \\
\textbf{Comet:}\\
Increases the Torp stat of DDs in the fleet by 15\%, does not stack with other command skills that have a similar effect; deploys a smokescreen (+40\% Evasion Rate for ships inside the smoke) for 5s at the beginning of the battle and every 15s after that at a 30\% chance.\\
\textbf{Skill (Cygnet):}\\
30\% activation every 20 seconds, evade all incoming attacks for 6 seconds; deploys a smokescreen (+40\% Evasion Rate for ships inside the smoke) for 5s at the beginning of the battle and every 15s after that at a 30\% chance.}
{Description: Da da da, smoke screen everydaaaay}
{This group of HMS DD is mostly remarkable for their low Oil cost, high Evasion, and being the cheapest delivery vehicle in the game for mass smokescreens.\\
Unusually for these sorts of teams, its members' statlines differ slightly: Crescent is shooty (high FP), Comet is torpy (high Torp), Cygnet is slippery (high Eva). Equip and wield them accordingly.}

\entry{FFNF Forbin Kai, MNF Le mars}[ForbinKai_Le_Mars.png]
{\textbf{Forbin:}\\
When escort fleet consists of only FFNF and/or MNF ships, 50\% chance every 20s to decrease entire fleet's damage sustained by 30\% for 8 seconds; 30\% activation every 20s, evades all incoming attacks for 6s.\\
\textbf{Le Mars:}\\
When escort fleet consists of only FFNF and/or MNF ships, 50\% chance every 20s to increase entire fleet's damage output by 25\% for 8 seconds; 30\% activation every 20s, evades all incoming attacks for 6s.}
{}
{What these young squires lack in survivability, make up for it with their great buffs.\\
Identical in stats and usage, whichever you pick gives you a different flavour of support; make sure to keep them safe and they'll repay your french frontline's efforts in spades. Their weaponry isn't half bad, either.}

\newpage
\subsection{ Honorable Mention}
\entry{USS Fletcher}[Fletcher.png]
{Increases Firepower and Evasion of all Fletcher-Class in fleet by 30\%; Increases Firepower, Torpedo, and Reload of DDs in the fleet by 10\%.\\
Craftable and farmable.}
{}
{Paired with 2 other Fletcher-class ships (any 2), excellent for 0LB farming purposes. Works better in CN than it does in JP because of the higher 0LB level cap, but they're still rather respectable as an ensemble.}

\entry{HMS Acasta (Kai)}[AcastaKai.png]
{If Acasta is the last ship alive in the Escort fleet, increases own damage dealt by 50\% and increases own damage received by 20\%; after battle begins and with a 30\% chance to activate every 15 seconds after that, deploys a smokescreen for 5 second and escort ships within the smokescreen have 40\% additional Evasion Rate; reduces the damage taken by the Flagship by 25\%.\\
Glorious Fight mini-event.}
{}
{An interesting and highly undesirable main skill makes Acasta a poor pick under most circumstances... but if you want to give yourself a challenge and go all-out on your Touhou skills, there's few finer ships than she.\\
Bring a sacrificial Bulin along, let it sink and let her rip. Good luck.}

\entry{IJN Shiranui}[Shiranui.png]
{30\% chance to launch a second salvo on torpedo launch.\\
Farmable}
{}
{One of the top DD choices for a 0LB min-cost farm fleet due to her high torpedo stat, low fuel usage, and chain torpedo skill.}
 
 
 
\newpage
\section[CL]{CL (Light Cruiser, Yellow gun icon)}
 
\subsection{Tier 0}
\entry{USS San Diego Kai}[San_DiegoKai.png]
{15\% proc chance when firing her AA guns, increase fleet's Anti-Air by 50\% for 8s; increase own AA by 25\% and every 20s launches a wide (1/4 of the width of the screen) torrent of quick stars with slight homing capabilities. [Innate] Can equip DD guns.}
{The Star among the Stripes}
{They finally did it, the madmen. Not only they Kai'd Azur Lane's greatest meme, they even made her the hero she was always supposed to be - sporting one whole extra Main Gun Mount, some much needed markups in Firepower and Efficiency, a shiny new and dazzling (but ultimately not too powerful) barrage and EVEN MORE anti-air capabilities, neither the skies nor the seas present any challenge to the once most unwanted gold unit in the game.
You'll still want to give her an Oxygen Torpedo or two, though - her torp stat remains abysmal, and even if it's not the torps you're taking her for there's no reason to let them rot. Besides, fireworks go great with a nice, starry night.}

\entry{IJN Jintsuu Kai}[JintsuuKai.png]
{-20\% Damage taken to self, +10\% Torpedo Critical chance and +30\% Torpedo Critical Damage to all DD/CL in Fleet; +20\% Reload and Torpedo to all DD/CL in Fleet.}
{}
{Jintsuu offers extreme flexibility with her combination of decent durability, great supporting skills, and overwhelming Torpedo power (highest Torpedo stat among CLs AND highest Torpedo Efficiency in the game). Probably the only issue is the difficulty in getting her (since it requires reaching and farming stage 10-4).}
 
 
\newpage
\subsection{Tier 1}
\entry{USS Phoenix}[Phoenix.png]
{Once per battle, when HP falls under 20\%, heals 25\% HP and increases firepower by 30\% for 15s.}
{}
{Phoenix's claim to fame is her skill, which makes her a monster in PvE clear fleets and powerful in PvP both.}

\entry{USS Montpelier}[Montpelier.png]
{60\% activation every 20s, decrease the damage all allied cruisers receive by 15\% and increase firepower and accuracy by 25\% for 8s; 25\% chance on firing AA guns to boost AA by 40\% and reduce Firepower by 20\% for 3s.\\
Craftable.}
{}
{Creme de la creme of the Cleveland class by virtue of a slightly superior statline (compared to her sisters') and an absolute bomb of a Cruiser buffing skill. A must-include for most Cruiser-heavy compositions.}

\entry{USS St. Louis}[St_Louis.png]
{60\% chance every 20s to boost her own Firepower, Reload, and Evasion by 30\% for 10s; 25\% chance on firing AA guns to boost AA by 40\% and reduce Firepower by 20\% for 3s.\\
Craftable or Farmable, 10-3 stage all nodes}
{It's not luck, it's all skill}
{Lewdis' rather impressive statline goes exceedingly well with a solid set of self-buffs to all relevant stats for a Gun-CL like herself, letting her withstand amounts of punishment that would fell a lesser CL or fire harder and faster than much of her competition.}

\entry{HMS Belchan}[Belchan.png]
{Increase Speed by 8 and increase evade by 25\%; after battle begins, recover HP of entire fleet equal to 3.5\% of Belchan's max HP.} 
{}
{The cutest Belfast you'll ever see, and with a brand new support-focused skillset to boot. Not quite as powerful as her grown-up version, but she's considerably more Evasive and that full fleet healing is quite helpful.}

\entry{HMS Edinburgh}[Edinburgh.png]
{Increase AP damage by 25\%.}
{}
{Edinburgh is in a similar situation as Cleveland. While her skill is arguably MORE relevant, she is placed here mostly based on her stat. She trades some offense for even MORE tankiness compared to Cleveland, and is indisputably the tankiest CL in the game. Very powerful in an all HMS setup.}
 
\entry{HMS Leander Kai}[LeanderKai.png]
{ Increases Firepower of Cruisers (both CL and CA) in the fleet by 15\%; At battle start and 20\% chance at every 20s thereafter, create a smokescreen that lasts 5s. Smokescreen provides 40\% evasion.}
{}
{A great statline, a discount price-tag, a Firepower buff for cruisers, a very annoying smokescreen for your PvP foes to deal with, and a smile to melt your heart. What's not to like?}
 
\entry{HMS Neptune (PROTOTYPE RESEARCH)}[HMS_Neptune.png]
{+35\% AP damage; Once per battle and when falling below 20\% HP, heals herself by 25\% HP and raises her Reload by 30\% until the end of the battle; +15\% damage vs Sirens.}
{Waitress, not maid.}
{Unlike Hood and Monarch's case, there is no real ambiguity here - Neptune does do Phoenix's job better, although at a considerably higher cost.\\
Armed with an excellent AP barrage and a very powerful AP boosting passive, and protected by the largest HP pool in her class and a better version of Phoenix's self-rescue skill, Neptune is perfectly capable of carrying on the fight for much longer while simultaneously making it much shorter than her USS counterpart could do.}

 
\newpage
\subsection{Tier 1.5}
\entry{USS Cleveland}[Cleveland.png]
{25\% chance every 20s to boost Damage fleetwide by 25\%; 25\% chance on firing AA guns to boost AA by 40\% and reduce Firepower by 20\% for 3s.}
{The Original Dadster}
{Cleveland may be somewhat overshadowed by her siscon Montpelier owing to her much more reliable buff, but her statline remains as good as it's ever been - and +25\% Damage to the entire fleet is still huge, if Lady Luck favours you.}

\entry{USS Helena (T0 vs bosses)}[Helena.png]
{ 60\% chance every 20s to make all enemies on the screen take 40\% more damage for 10s}
{}
{Helena is exceedingly good against bosses and merely alright everywhere else. \\
While the power of her debuff is unparalled, it's hard to make sure she will proc when you need her to - either because the enemy has died already or there's no worthy targets on the screen, as tends to happen on mob nodes, or because it just won't proc due to bad luck; only boss fights tend to drag on for long enough to guarantee her debuff will proc and get some use.}
 
\entry{USS Columbia}[Columbia.png]
{Reduces the damage taken by the Flagship by 25\%; 25\% chance on firing AA guns to boost AA by 40\% and reduce Firepower by 20\% for 3s.}
{}
{Ever wanted to use Hammann but didn't want to deal with her terrible stats and weaponry? Well, now you can.\\
All the utility of her skills with the sturdiness and DPS of the Cleveland-class. Splendid.}

\entry{HMS Ajax / Achilles Kai}[Ajax_AchillesKai.png]
{60\% chance every 20s to boost Firepower by 40\% for 10s; increases damage dealt to CAs by 25\%.}
{}
{Ajax/Achilles is a brutal offensive machine, but is put down by their relatively poor defenses.}

\entry{HMS Belfast}[Belfast.png]
{Increase HE damage by 25\% and chance to ignite fire by 3\%; 10s after battle starts and 20\% chance at every 20s thereafter, create a smokescreen that lasts 10s. Smokescreen provides 35\% evasion and 35\% reduced damage taken from airstrikes.}
{}
{Hot maid, in more ways than one. Dealing more damage than usual with HE guns and packing better torps than every other HMS cruiser, she tends to have a good answer for most Light and Heavy Armour shaped issues - but not a great one on either side, and her smokescreen is almost entirely useless in PvE with its terrible procrate and planes not attacking you.\\
Her place is strictly PvP, as there's many other HMS CL who will do what she does - be it DPS or tanking - better for less.}

\entry{HMS Sheffield}[Sheffield.png]
{Allied ships with lower health than Sheffield at the start of battle will have a 30.0\% chance of receiving 50.0\% less damage; increases own main gun's critical rate by 12.0\% and critical damage by 30\%.}
{}
{Neither as tanky as Edinburgh nor quite as powerful as Belfast, Sheffield does an admirable job of being something of a middle ground between the two, with a slant towards the RNG. Her defensive skill is one of the best in the game - make sure to keep Sheffield's HP up.}
 
\entry{IJN Abukuma Kai}[AbukumaKai.png]
{15\% boost of torpedo stat to every DD in the fleet; 30\% chance to launch a second salvo on torpedo launch.}
{}
{Abukuma is a DD-support CL. Her own torpedo stat is high, and she is mostly there as a tankier alternative to Kagerou in a DD-heavy composition}

\entry{IJN Sendai Kai}[SendaiKai.png]
{Increases reload and torpedo stat for all DD/CL in the same fleet by 15\%; 10 seconds after battle begins, and 40\% chance to activate every 20s after that, deploys a flare for 10 seconds and enemy's ships within the flare have their evasion rate decreased by 25\%. }
{}
{A slightly weaker Jintsuu who stole a few notes from Aurora's book. Her statline is still damn good, though, and their buffs can stack. So does the EvaRate reduction, if you REALLY want to stick it to those DD in PvP.}

\subsection{Tier 2}
\entry{USS Brooklyn}[Brooklyn.png]
{Increases Firepower of Cruisers (both CL and CA) in the fleet by 15\%.}

{A worse Leander Kai, has the benefit of being a gunboat, but inferior statwise and lacks additional benefits.}
 
\entry{USS Denver}[Denver.png]
{60\% activation every 20s, increases own FP by 40\% for 8s; 25\% activation when attacking with AA guns, increase AA by 40\% but decreases FP by 20\% for 3s.}
{}
{The weakest of the Solomon Cavaliers, which means she's still pretty solid. She'll only buff herself, but +40\% FP never really goes amiss.}

\entry{USS Honolulu}[Honolulu.png]
{60\% activation every 20s, increases own FP by 40\% for 8s.}
{}
{More Firepower and better Efficiency than what Denver gets and doesn't need to worry about planes mugging her precious FP, but at the cost of a much flimsier hull. A solid pick regardless, especially if you expect aircraft.}

\entry{HMS Aurora}[Aurora.png]
{Increases own damage against destroyers, transport vessels, torpedo boats, and suicide boats by 20\%; decreases the evasion rate of all enemy destroyers and light cruisers by 20\%.}
{}
{Excellent but niche DD/CL-busting skills paired with average CL stats, with the glaring exception of her sub-par HP. More suited for PvP than PvE, especially against HMS frontlines. Oh the irony.}

\entry{IJN Agano}[Agano.png]
{Increases Firepower of Destroyers in the same fleet by 15\%, doesn't stack with other instances of this skill; when alive in fleet, reduce damage taken by allied CV/L by 15\%, doesn't stack with other instances of this skill.}
{}
{Agano is an interesting little beastie, proud owner of an unconventional kit (DD FP boost, CV/L defence boost) and... less proud owner of a somewhat unremarkable statline for IJN CL, especially when compared to Sendai and Jintsuu. While she isn't a bad unit on her own by any stretch, her competitors are more powerful and their skills more wieldy and impactful than hers - which means her best use would be as a DD FP buffer, similarly to London.}

\entry{KMS Leipzig}[Leipzig.png]
{Increases Firepower, Torpedo, and Reload of Cruisers (both CL and CA) in the fleet by 10\%.}
{}
{Leipzig is a solid buff-provider, but is put down by her own somewhat lacking stats. Best used in an all-KMS lineup for maximum impact, but she has a place in any frontline.}

\entry{FFNF Emile Bertin (T1.5 with French DD)}[Emile_Bertin.png]
{During sortie, increases Firepower, Torpedo stat and Accuracy of FFNF (Le Triomphant, Forbin) and MNF (Le Mars) DDs by 15\%; During sortie, if the escort fleet is composed of Emile Bertin and DDs only, increases own Speed by 4 and increases own damage against DD/CL by 20\%. }
{}
{An ideal escort for French DDs, and not entirely without merit when deployed with other nations' destroyers. Her buffs are pretty decent, her barrage is good and her statline is alright, if somewhat low on the HP side; all in all, a solid entry in the CL roster.}

Craftable.}
{}
{Obscenely slow (pre-Kai), pitiful HP and middling torps at best; Yat Sen is somewhat more interesting, with her double guns and twin AA mount, but her statline is lacking and her skill doesn't affect herself.\\
Nothing about these three looks usable, until you start deploying them together --- at which point the sisters start hitting as hard as CAs and evade better than DDs, easily outshining most of the T1.5 or T1 in the game.\\
Lots of investment needed and Yat Sen MUST be protected at all costs (hint, place her between Ping and Ning), but worth it.}

\subsection{ Honorable Mention}
\entry{USS Juneau}[Juneau.png]
{When sunk, heals all other ships in fleet for 25\% HP.}
{}
{Has a niche use in PvP trollish defense fleets. Worthless otherwise, just like the rest of the Atalanta-class.}
 
\entry{USS San Diego}[San_Diego.png]
{15\% activation chance when attacking with AA guns, increase fleet AA by 50\% for 8s. }
{The undisputed, unwanted AA queen}
{San Diego has had, for the longest time, a terrible reputation --- hailed as the prime example of rarity not being an indication of quality, her reputation is somewhat deserved, considering her main claim to glory is tons of AA (to the detriment of the rest of her offensive stats) when AA is only really needed in W12, a steep Oil price tag and a tendency to appear in crafting whenever you don't want her to... but that's not all there is to it.\\
The usual claim is that San Diego can't do anything to surface enemies; if you were to use her as a normal CL this would be correct, as her FP is low and her Gun Efficiency is worse. However, her barrage can dish out surprising amounts of damge and she can mount DD guns, which means she can spam said powerful barrage; moreover, while her Torpedo stat is abysmal, her Torpedo Efficiency is good enough, meaning she can benefit a lot from auxiliary torpedoes.\\
Does all this redeem her, then? Not really --- even in this fashion, you'd need to manually control her and you'd need lots of high-end gear to get her to perform properly. If you're not expecting planes and you don't care about her, feel free to scrap her as you always did; if you do, then Sandy might just be what you need.}

\entry{SN Avrora}[Avrora.png]
{Increase Damage inflicted by the frontline by 35\%.\\
\textbf{Special:}\\ Has MGM+1 and Torpedoes.}
{\foreignlanguage{russian}{Союз нерушимый республик свободных}~} %"♪♫♬"
{The burden and glory of the true revolutionary is heavy indeed, and Avrora shows it through and through.\\
Her buff is the absolute best in the entire game, no exception allowed; she gets MGM+1 while keeping her torps, a rarity only six other ships have access to; and her Armour is Medium, letting her outlast a good number of her competitors.\\
As amazing as all this sounds, she is let down by one glaring flaw - her abysmal offensive statline, which even her impressive buff struggles to shore up, compounded with pre-WW1-era engines that grant her the questionable honour of being the slowest ship in the game (tied with Yat Sen).\\
All that said, unlike Yat Sen she is certainly usable; okay-ish on her own and an amazing force multiplier, having her around won't cut into your DPS to the point of crippling your fleet and will help your other ships MvP.}

\subsection{Tier 0}
\entry{FFNF Saint Louis (PROTOTYPE RESEARCH)}[Saint_Louis.png]
{+35\% HE damage and -3\% Ignition chance; +8 Speed (permanent) and +35\% Eva (for 40s); +15\% damage vs Sirens.}
{DESU VULT!}
{Historically praised by multiple navies as one of the absolute best heavy cruiser designs but robbed of its chance to shine due to the fall of France in WW2, Azur Lane's Saint Louis has come to set the record straight --- and does she ever.\\
Mightiest of all CA by weight of stats and skills, there is no area where she doesn't excel - her guns absolutely melt opposing Light Armour and punch through Heavy Armour better than any other frontliners' in the game, her Speed is slightly superior to that of CLs and enjoys a hefty boost to her already high Evasion for more than half a minute after the battle starts, her AA is uncharacteristically high for her class and she enjoys all the perks of her Spe-CA peers (Medium Armour, MGM+1 and Torpedoes).\\
The only fault one can find in her would be her barrage - its wide linear pattern helps dispatching multiple weak foes, yes, but also neuters its impact against single targets.}

\entry{USS Minneapolis}[Minneapolis.png]
{+15\% Firepower and +30\% Reload for 12s after killing an enemy vessel, if skill is already active it will refresh the duration; when Minneapolis' HP falls under 30\%, lose 2 Speed but gain -10\% damage sustained and heal 4\% HP every 3s for 16s (can only proc once per fight).}
{Monster Hunter}
{Upgunned, uparmoured, upskilled and, alas, upcosted. In most regards, Minneapolis is indeed a direct step-up from Phoenix: her CA guns massively overpower her predecessor's CL ones, the Medium Armour cuts incoming gunfire damage in half, the heal is somewhat slower but comes with a handy damage resistance buff... but it's the +FP +Reload buff when taking enemies down that's the real deal and kicks her DPS into really high gear, as long as there's targets for her to take down.}

\entry{USS Portland Kai}[PortlandKai.png]
{+15\% FP, AA, Reload when sortied with Indianapolis; 15\% chance every 20s to reduce damage taken by 15\% for 8s.}
{}
{Exceptional HP, twice the Evasion other CAs get, high Firepower and high AA - in a similar fashion to Cleveland, her stats alone justify her rating and the skills are just icing on the cake. She won't hit as often as Wichita or as hard as Chicago, but she's much more consistent and hard to kill.}
 
\entry{KMS Roon (PROTOTYPE RESEARCH)}[Roon.png]
{Rotates between HE and AP ammo every two Main Gun salvo regardless of the original gun's ammo, and raises her Reload by +3.5\% (up to +42\%) for every Main Gun salvo; Generates four revolving shields (2 very close, 1 near, 1 far)  every 30s; +15\% damage vs Sirens.}
{Roon and delay!}
{In many ways, Saint Louis and Roon stand at opposite ends. \\
Whereas the former starts out strong and loses some of her lustre as the battle drags on, the latter only gets stronger; where the former's barrage is uncomfortably wide, the latter's is very concentrated and devastating; where the former relies on high speed and evasion to stay out of harm's way, the latter simply adds layers of HP and shields to power through the barrages; and as the former gradually mellows out of her cold templar persona, the latter grows ever more violent and unhinged.\\
As a result, Roon is best served on boss battles - where she has time to rev up her guns and let the concentrated barrage tear single hard targets apart.}

\entry{IJN Mogami Kai}[MogamiKai.png]
{60\% activation every 20s, increases own FP by 40\% for 10s; reduce AP damage taken by self by 10\% (20\%); whenever own torpedoes hit 5 times, increase own firepower by 8\%. Can be stacked up to 3 times.}
{}
{Step aside Portland, there's a new best CA in the game - at least on the offense.\\
While she is definitely less tanky, missing the extra 800 HP and 11 Evasion Port gets, she casts a massive shadow over her DPS thanks to higher Firepower, better Main Gun efficiency, better offensive skills, a much better barrage and, most importantly, still getting Main Gun +1 despite the torps as if she were a gunboat.}
 
 
\newpage
\subsection{Tier 1}
\entry{USS Wichita}[Wichita.png]
{Increases Firepower of Cruisers (both CL and CA) in the fleet by 15\%; 25\% chance when firing main guns to fire another salvo.}
{}
{Can you say 24 shots in a row? She certainly can. Wichita is THE heaviest frontline DPS in the entire game, bar none. Her HP is rather lacklustre, but it's an easily solved issue and dead enemies can't hurt you anyway.}

\entry{IJN Choukai}[Choukai.png]
{Increase own Firepower by 10\% and 60\% chance every 20s to increase all allied cruisers' Firepower and Torpedo Stat by 20\% for 10s; 30\% chance when firing main cannons to inflict double damage.}
{}
{The pride and joy of the Takao-class, she's the only one who actually bothers buffing her sisters (as well as other cruisers) and gets that guns are better than torpedoes for heavy cruisers; as a result, she's a notch above her sisters and most Torp-CA.}
 
 
\newpage
\subsection{Tier 1.5}
\entry{USS Astoria}[Astoria.png]
{When sortied with New Orleans-class ships (Quincy, Vincennes), increase all New Orleans-class ships Accuracy and Anti-Air by 5\% (20\%) and Firepower by 4\% (10\%); passively reduces gun-based damage from enemy DDs and CLs by 20\%. }
{}
{Leader of the New Orleans class, she emphasises their strengths and shares their reinforced armour plating. No reason not to take her if you're going to field them at all.}

\entry{USS Chicago}[Chicago.png]
{Main gun shots have a 30\% chance to inflict double damage.}
{}
{What was said about Wichita applies to Chicago as well. Slightly frailer than she is and needing RNG to get the most out of her, she will nonetheless punch hard - and harder than anyone else when she does proc. Also worth mentioning, if she procs on her first salvo, the buff affects the second one too!}

\entry{USS Houston}[Houston.png]
{Main gun shots have a 20\% chance to increase own Evasion by 100\% for 15s.}
{Problem? What problem?}
{While an Evasion-focused CA sounds ludicrous, and it is under most circumstances, Houston actually makes it work given enough Evasion-boosting auxiliaries: CAs live and die by their Evasion (or lack thereof), so stacking it actually lets her survive under heavy fire for much longer than you'd expect. \\
What issues she does have are fairly minor: she needs to proc to get tough, obviously, but her uptime is high and she has two chances to proc per firing cycle; and her damage output isn't as high as it could be, since her only skill is that Evasion buff, but it's still higher than most non-CA (and many Torp-CA) frontliners manage.}

\entry{USS Quincy/Vincennes}[Quincy_Vincennes.png]
{Increases own Firepower by 40\% for 10s on a 60\% 20s proc; passively reduces gun-based damage from enemy DDs and CLs by 20\%. }
{}
{Sporting a matching set of Medium Armour, anti-DD/CL gunfire skills and considerable AA capabilities, the New Orleans-class CAs focus more on the defence than the offence, unlike almost every other CA in the USS. A good fit for mob- as well as boss-hunting, considering how frequent are DD and CL bosses, but beware their weaker guns and the need to take Astoria to make the most out of them.}

\entry{HMS Suffolk Kai (T1 when deployed with Queen Elizabeth)}[SuffolkKai.png]
{25\% chance when firing main guns to fire another salvo; 60\% chance every 20s to increase Firepower by 40\% for 10s.}
{}
{Boasting the highest Firepower stat out of all the non-event CAs and armed with a pair of skills further capitalising on such Firepower, she's a few notches above every other Torp-CA and has access to QE's buffs to boot. Just as frail as Wichita, though, and she's still a Torp-CA at heart.}
 
\entry{IJN Atago}[Atago.png]
{Increases HE Damage by 15\%, HE burn chance by 12\% and burn damage by 50\%; 30\% chance to launch a second salvo on torpedo launch.}
{}
{Atago is hot as hell in more ways than one. The second most gun-focused of the Takao-class, she provides the most stable output and a considerable amount of it as well - though of course not as much as a Gun-CA would. Let the seas burn.}

\entry{IJN Ibuki (PROTOTYPE RESEARCH)}[Ibuki.png]
{+40\% Torp CritRate, +65\% CritDmg; 30\% chance to fire a torpedo barrage when launching torpedoes; +15\% damage vs Sirens.}
{What do you mean 'she's not a DD'?}
{Someone at the design bureau must've missed a memo when they designed Ibuki. \\
Sporting an IJN DD's skillset and an IJN CA's statline, her entire being is at odds with her purpose as a dedicated torpedo delivery system. While she starts with TWO preloaded torp spreads and her said spreads can be exceedinhgly powerful, her torpedo stat is low and bolstering is hard, as she lacks access to the Sendai-class' buffs and OxyTorp auxiliaries come at the expense of survivability; at the same time, while her guns pack a respectable punch for a Torp-CA, they are completely neglected by her skillset and tend to fulfil the same purpose a DD's guns would (give her something to do while reloading).\\
As a result, Ibuki's performance more closely resembles that of a high-end DD than a CA's - rush in, unload torps, sit down and wait to be useful again as torps reload --- despite (mostly) enjoying the benefits of her CA statline.}

\entry{IJN Maya}[Maya.png]
{Increases Reload by 35\% and 30\% chance to launch a second salvo on torpedo launch.}
{}
{Maya trades Takao's double damage chance for a permanent passive reload boost. An interesting concept, and paired with double Autoloaders lets her fire her guns and torps than any other CA, which is remarkable on its own right; however, such consistency is paid with an even lower potential damage output than that of Atago.\\
Also, she's slightly better at AA than her sisters (key word being "slightly", though).}

\entry{IJN Takao}[Takao.png]
{30\% chance to do double damage when firing main gun; 30\% chance to launch a second salvo on torpedo launch.}
{}
{Takao is a tad on the RNG side, but sports high HP and a remarkable statline. Her skills are what makes her as good as she is, but they're not exactly the most reliable. Still, they are powerful and thus worth respect.}

\entry{IJN Furutaka / Kako Kai}[Furutaka_KakoKai.png]
{60\% activation every 20s, increases own FP by 40\% for 10s; every torpedo launch has a 30.0\% chance to launch another round.}
{}
{Think Takao, except slightly less powerful with their skills but much more reliable and inexpensive. Often unfairly overlooked, but there's few better CAs for their cost.}

\entry{KMS Deutschland / Graf Spee}[Deutschland_Graf_Spee.png]
{Increases damage dealt to DD and CL by 35\%.}
{}
{Deutschland boasts the highest base Firepower among ALL CAs in the game, and her bully of a skill makes her a superb member of a PvE clear fleet, while also being a great piece of an all-KMS PvP fleet.\\
Graf Spee is almost identical to her sister, the only difference being slightly more HP and slightly less FP.}

{What you use when you don't have Wichita but still want a powerful, buff-capable CA.}
 
\entry{HMS London}[London.png]
{Increases Firepower of the entire frontline by 15\%.}
{}
{HMS CA get a bad reputation for being frail and either undergunned or undertorped, despite possessing rather valuable skills. London is one such example, but she rescues herself from the mediocrity of her statline by virtue of being one of the only two frontliners that can buff DD FP - a small niche, admittedly, but a useful one if you plan on fielding multiple DD with good guns.}

\entry{KMS Admiral Hipper}[Admiral_Hipper.png]
{Every 30s, spawns 2 shields that last 15s and blocks 10 shots; 8\% chance to reduce any damage taken by 50\% on taking damage.}

\entry{KMS Prinz Eugen}[Prinz_Eugen.png]
{70\% chance every 20s to spawn 3 shields that lasts 10s and blocks 10 shots.}

{It's exceedingly rare for a frontliner to have more HP than carriers and battlecruisers, but Prinz Eugen makes it happen. Proud owner of a HP pool larger than 90\% of the ships in the game, she pays for this priviledge by being saddled with a semi-useless skill and poor offensive stats.\\
If you're looking that something that won't die anytime soon, look no further; if you're looking for something that can do anything more than that, look everywhere else.}

\subsection{Tier 0}
\entry{USS Washington}[Washington.png]
{70\% chance every 20s to fire a strong barrage (mid-ranged conal machinegun sweep, long range focused bombardment); when South Dakota's HP falls to/below 30\%, South Dakota gains Protection (avoid lethal damage for 5s) while Washington deals +20\% damage and absorbs 30\% of the damage sustained by South Dakota.}
{Smile for the FCR!}
{Large and in charge, Washington is the head honcho of the American battleships and she'll make damn sure she drives the point home with her superb timed barrage. Unlike most barrages, Washi shells the midfield about as hard as she does the backline and doesn't need to fire her guns to launch it, which lets you decide when you actually want to fire as opposed to being forced to.\\
Her synergy with South Dakota is likewise very powerful, but somewhat more suited for PvP than it is for PvE (as your backline will seldom be seriously threatened by enemies) - still, if your back is taking too much damage, it'll help them turn the tables.}

\entry{HMS Duke of York}[Duke_of_York.png]
{Every 20 seconds, fires a barrage (behaves like a 356mm quad cannon and aims at the farthest target on the screen). Enemies hit by the barrage have their movement speed decreased by 40\% for 6 seconds; once per battle, increases the damage of the first volley by 50\%. Enemies that are hit by Duke of York's salvo take an additional 12\% damage for 8 seconds.}
{}
{With stats coming close to Warspite's stellar FP and Reload and a suite of skills aimed at softening the enemy up, not only she can lay on the hurt but she can also make sure her fellow warships do the same. A worthy inclusion in every fleet.}

\entry{HMS Hood}[Hood.png]
{ 70\% chance on firing main gun to fire a special barrage and increase main fleet reload by 40\% for 8s.}
{More than just a sub}
{Second only to Tirpitz in terms of pure staying power and armed with a quickly-proccable, backline-buffing, devastating barrage, she is exceptionally good under almost all circumstances; whether it is tearing apart mob nodes, showering enemy battleships in heavy firepower or providing support, Hood gets it done.\\
Remember to have her be the flagship to make the most out of her barrage, and that the lower the cooldown on her main gun, the better.}

\entry{HMS Monarch (PROTOTYPE RESEARCH)}[Monarch.png]
{70\% chance to fire a special AP barrage, lowering the affected units' Speed by 40\%; When HP falls below 20\% restores 3\% of her HP every 2s for 8s, and for every 1\% HP lost (in a single battle) Reload increases by 1; +15\% damage vs Sirens.}
{Rule the waves.}
{It'd be easy to regard Monarch as a straight upgrade to Hood. She mounts CL guns, Her FP is much higher, her Efficiencies are better, her barrage is AP and she can even heal herself... what more could one possibly want from a battleship?\\
The truth isn't quite so simple, though. While Monarch's statline is indeed superior (with the glaring exception of AA) and the self-heal greatly extends her operational time even beyond Hood's already impressive one, Monarch's barrage will neither quicken the backline's pace nor can it be used with the same reckless abandon due to the AP modifiers; while she won't fall flat against Light Armour, courtesy of her excellent regular shelling, she doesn't quite match Hood's supportive capabilities and weight of fire.\\
As a result, it would be wise to pick your sovereign of choice with an eye to battlefield conditions - if enemy BB/C are out for blood or Medium/Heavy Armour is getting you down, Monarch will weather their storm and put them in their place with staggering ease.}

\entry{MNF Jean Bart}[Jean_Bart.png]
{Every first main gun salvo damage is increased by 60\%, and all manually aimed salvo damage is increased by 60\%; when equipped with the Quadruple 380mm (Mle 1935), main gun critical rate is increased by 30\% and main gun critical damage is increased by 50\%.}
{The terror of the Seven Seas}
{As befitting of a pirate queen, Jean Bart doesn't play by the rules: while lacking a third salvo would be a net loss on a dreadnought's effectiveness on the field, Jean makes up for it in spades by showing up to the fight with her horrifically overcharged guns already loaded, resulting in damage spikes that would make Ayanami blush.\\
Volume of fire is ultimately maintained by her gun, firing a respectable 8 shots in total, and cooldowns aren't a concern either thanks to her higher-than-normal Reload; whatever she's facing, it's heading straight to Davy Jones' locker.\\
Absolutely devastating, and unlike Tirpitz she has no compunctions about fellow dreadnoughts. The Jolliest Roger of them all.}

{Anti-air for backliners is a bit of a meme, but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one.\\
North Carolina goes harder than anyone else on the AA front, as far as backliners are concerned - not only does she prevent plane damage with her skill, she also grows stronger the more AA she acquires (and she's plenty strong to begin with, sporting a very high base FP thanks to said skill).\\
Whether you do actually need all that AA is another matter entirely, but rest assured that she will lay on the hurt even if you don't - and if you do, that's just gravy.}

\entry{IJN Hyuuga}[Hyuuga.png]

{Mikasa for those who don't have her or like CVs better
A well-rounded warship on her own right compared to her dakka-centric senpai, her set of buffs is about as good as those provided by Mikasa but she needs the flagship slot even more due to her barrage.\\
Place her there and she'll carry your IJN fleet to glory and triumph; place her to the sides and she's just a very solid BB.}

\entry{KMS Tirpitz}[Tirpitz.png]
{30\% damage increase when Tirpitz is the only BB/BC in the fleet; Every 15s, launches 4 Magnetic Torpedoes.}
{}
{THE hardest-hitting, toughest ship in the game. Pair her with CV/CVL/BBVs only, because her damage increase is the main reason for her power; the homing torpedoes are the sweet, sweet icing on the cake and let her get some free damage on enemy mobs or, more often, intercept suicide boats before they even come close.\\
As good as all this sounds, though, her total lack of synergy with other battleships seriously hampers her usability, precluding her access to great buffers like Duke of York or Hood as well as severely weakening her.}

{Another tough bastard, just like her sister South Dakota. Massive amounts of HP and AA let her tank more blows than most, while her self-buff works with units you're probably going to use anyway (and unlike Prince of Wales, without forcing you into an all-USS lineup). \\
Her Firepower is likewise exceptional, but her special shells are a double-edged sword --- while she WILL pierce Heavy Armour like nobody's business, her firing angle is so high that she'll struggle landing shots on moving targets. }

\entry{USS Oklahoma/Nevada Kai}[OklahomaKai_NevadaKai.png]
{8\% to halve an incoming damage; 30\% chance for x2 damage on Main Gun fire.}
{South Dakota Lite}
{Similar in form, statline and function to her bigger, blacker cousin, - AA and backline-wide tank skill aside - these cowgirls operate at a fraction of Sodak's cost while providing similar results. Still RNG, yes, but still quite solid.}

\entry{USS South Dakota}[South_Dakota.png]
{Every 30s, absorb 50\% damage taken by main fleet for 8s, then heal for 50\% of the damage taken during that time; 30\% chance to do double damage when firing main gun.}
{}
{While her tanking skill isn't good enough to make her the tank she's meant to be, she is undeniably hard to kill thanks to her large HP pool and all-around excellent stats, AA included (a rarity among BB/Cs); her double damage proc needs RNG to work, but when it does it will annihilate whatever she aimed at.}

\entry{HMS Queen Elizabeth (T0 in any HMS fleet)}[Queen_Elizabeth.png]
{Increases Firepower, Torpedo, Air Power, AA, Reload, and Evasion of HMS ships by 15\%.}
{}
{The core of most HMS fleets. If you're taking her, it's because of her worth as a force multiplier --- her statline is just alright, even after her own buffs, and there's much better picks for solo backliners.}

\entry{IJN Kirishima}[Kirishima.png]
{Damage against BB increased by 15\% and 60\% activation upon firing main gun, launches a frontal Sanshikidan barrage (8 shells in two waves of four).}
{}{(PvE) Airstrike murderer extraordinaire thanks to her barrage, accomplished suicide boat slayer owing to her very high animation speed, and gets an edge against the most threatening enemies you can face later on. An excellent defensive pick, as long as you let her be the flagship.}

\entry{IJN Ise}[Ise.png]
{Increase own FP by 20\%.}
{}
{More powerful than a stock Fusou or Yamashiro, slightly weaker than either when they have been pre-Kai'd and unable to go the same route as her BBV Kai node is very early on. This kind of pressures you into turning her into a battlecarrier --- but if you particularly like her the way she is, ignore the pressure and she'll keep blowing things sky-high as well as she has always done.}

\entry{IJN Kongou}[Kongou.png]
{While alive in fleet, increase firepower, accuracy by 15\% and evasion by 20\% for all Kongou-class (Kongou, Kirishima, Haruna, Hiei). }
{}
{Kongou-class support craft. Not very flashy, but her buffs are anything but unremarkable - the extra Evasion in particular makes a Kongou-class backline powerful and extremely hard to shift.}

\entry{IJN Yamashiro/Fusou}[Yamashiro_Fusou.png]
{Increases Firepower by 20\%; (Launches more seaplanes on first airstrike).}
{}
{The second most cost-effective BBs in the game, owing to their remarkable statline, Kai nodes and comparatively low Oil costs.\\
Their Kai is unique in that it is a sidegrade rather than an upgrade: when turned into BBV, they trade their CL guns and 1/3 of their BB salvo for seaplanes, letting them launch airstrikes as if they were carriers.\\
A steep price to pay, especially considering how weak the seaplanes are in comparison to 'proper' bombers, how slow the launches are in comparison to 'proper' carriers and how much better are Ise and Hyuuga as BBVs.}
 
\entry{KMS Gneisenau (T1 if deployed with Graf Zeppelin)}[Gneisenau.png]
{Increases Firepower by 25\%; Every 20s launches 3 unguided torpedoes.}

{Think Tirpitz, except not quite as hard-hitting and not as fussy about her company. She will outdamage all her competitors (excepting Hood), while still being able to defend herself through a set of CL guns.\\
A force to be reckoned with, especially considering her cost, but don't count on the torps to do much more than stop the occasional fireboat.}
 
\entry{KMS Scharnhorst (T1 if deployed with Graf Zeppelin)}[Scharnhorst.png]
{Every 15s, fires a 3-bullet (Normal, upgrades to AP after SL6) salvo at a random target. This salvo will automatically crit; Every 20s launches 3 unguided torpedoes.}
{}
{Think Warspite, except she doesn't have animation issues and isn't a showoff. Between her regular guns, the CL secondaries, the automated barrage and the torps, she will throw out more firepower than any other backliner in the game.\\
A force to be reckoned with, just like her sister; and just like her sister, don't count on her torps at all.}

\subsection{Tier 2}
\entry{USS California}[California.png]
{Skill: 30\% chance to proc on main gun fire, x2 damage on the entire volley.}
{}
{By most intents and purposes, a discount South Dakota who gives up her bigger, blacker sister's AA capabilities, a portion of her statline and her shield for a lower Oil cost. Still hits damn hard, though, and harder still when she's on a good roll.}

\entry{USS Pennsylvania}[Pennsylvania.png]
{60\% chance to proc every 20 seconds, fires a special barrage (multiple arcing salvo shelling a medium-sized area in the middle of the screen).}
{}
{Often overlooked in favour of other barrage ships (eg. Hood), Pennsylvania plays it different from many others by having a timed proc instead of a main-gun-fire-based one. While this means to equip whichever BB gun you'd like to stick on her, it also means that she may proc when you don't need her to and waste the barrage.\\
A bit fiddly, but arguably more flexible than most and just as powerful.}

\entry{HMS Warspite (T1.5 if deployed w/ Queen Elizabeth)}[Warspite.png]
{Every 15s, fires a 2-bullet AP salvo at the furthermost target. This salvo will automatically crit.}
{}
{Warspite mostly gains her spot by sporting the absolute highest base FP of any BB in the game (PR notwithstanding) and an okay statline elsewhere. What brings her down is her useless skill: an automated, autocritting barrage sounds great, until you realise it struggles immensely hitting anything that's not a stationary target and that the AP modifier makes it useless against the very common Light Armour in the game.}
 
\entry{HMS Renown (T1.5 if deployed w/ Queen Elizabeth)}[Renown.png]
{Every time the main gun is fired, increases the damage of the subsequent main gun attack by 15\%. }
{}
{Lo and behold, owing to solid FP and Reload as well as a good skill the Saberface's damage output is pretty good. DD secondary guns however mean she won't really be able to defend herself.}
 
\entry{HMS Prince of Wales}[Prince_of_Wales.png]
{For every USS ship in the fleet, increase her own Firepower, AA, Reload, and Evasion by 5\%.}
{}
{Demands a specific fleet composition, but the boost she gets from it is very solid, totaling to 25\% to each of the boosted stats.}
 
\entry{IJN Haruna}[Haruna.png]
{Every time the main gun is fired, increases own firepower and AA by 6\%. Can be stacked up to 4 times.}
{}
{Haruna takes a page from Zuikaku's book and ramps up her stats the more she shoots. She needs some time to do so, of course, but the results are worth the effort.}

\entry{IJN Izumo}[Izumo.png]
{70\% chance on Main Gun fire to launch a special non-arcing AP barrage; -35\% AP damage sustained, but up to +6\% chance to suffer Ignitions and extends Ignition duration by 3s; +15\% damage vs Sirens.}
{Consistently bad}
{One really has to wonder what has Izumo ever done to developers to warrant such a treatment.\\
As awful in AL as she is in WoWS, Izumo is bad by any standard - her barrage barely scratches Light Armour while being unable to bypass it due to the parallel shots, her 'defensive' skill harms her much more than it does protect her due to the complete absence of enemy BB AP (and prevalence of BB HE), and worse still, as a barrage boat she needs flagship slot... while sharing Mikasa, Nagato and Kirishima's nation.\\
Her sole saving grace is her exceptional statline, and even then it is marred by high Oil costs, comparatively low Efficiencies and is far from making any significant difference.\\
Bad not just by PR standards but as a whole, there is little to no reason to ever use her over any other barrage boat.}

\entry{IJN Mikasa (T0 with IJN BB/Cs)}[Mikasa.png]
{12\% Chance to reduce damage taken by 50\%, When sortied as flagship, increases allied IJN ship Firepower and Reload by 20\%; 60\% chance when firing main gun to increase damage done by allied BB and BC by 20\% for 8s.}
{}
{While her HP might be low and she may lack an AA gun, she does make up for it in spades through a superb Reload stat and astoundingly good buffs.\\
An iffy pick on her own, but a monstrous force multiplier for other IJN BB/Cs and no slouch herself. }

\entry{IJN Mutsu}[Mutsu.png]
{40\% activation when firing main gun, fires a frontal barrage (damage increases with skill).}
{}
{An oversized monitor like Rodney or Nelson, but with a good barrage and better stats.}
 
\entry{MNF Dunkerque}[Dunkerque.png]
{50\% activation upon firing main gun, launches a frontal barrage. }
{}
{The predecessor to Jean Bart, and it sadly shows.\\
Like Jean, she lacks her third salvo and can launch her bombardment immediately; unlike Jean, said bombardment operates just like any other and is considerably weaker as a result, while her barrage fires on a coin toss.\\
All that said, she'll always get to fire one more volley per round than 99\% of the other dreadnoughts and her gun efficiency is very high. Decent, all things considered.}


\newpage
\subsection{ Honorable Mention}
\entry{HMS Abercrombie}[Abercrombie.png]
{15 seconds after the start of battle and every 20 seconds thereafter, 60\% chance of activating a special barrage (damage based on skill level). }
{Small Girl, Big Gun}
{On paper, Abby looks like a direct improvement over her counterparts. A longer, better-versus-MidArmour barrage and better stats all around make her a very promising candidate for powercreep examples --- weren't for the fact that her firing is off-centre, which limits her ability to actually hit targets to the point where fireboats on the bottom half of the screen will always slip past. Her barrage also suffers from this, but it's not as noticeable.\\
Either way, don't use her until she's fixed.}

\entry{HMS Terror \& Erebus}[Terror_Erebus.png]
{Every 20s, 60\% chance to fire a special barrage.}
{The poor man's Barrage Boat}
{A description partly in jest, and partly absolutely accurate --- compared to a normal BB, they are incredibly frail (barely 3k HP with Light Armour) and considerably weaker (low FP, slightly lower Efficiency, one less salvo per volley), but they also cost a fraction than what they do and still get truly impressive barrages.\\
How does this come together? As pint-sized discount-costed powerhouses for early world farming, that's how: while low, their Firepower is enough to stop fireboats in their tracks, and if given enough Evasion, they can be reliably expected (post-lv100) to evade incoming BB salvo, prolonging their operational time much beyond what their abysmal statline would lead you to believe.\\
Monitors can be expected to auto their way up to W9 with little resistance. Any further, though, and auto becomes almost impossible as enemies get more accurate, tougher and more powerful: the moment a BB opens up on them, they're already dead.}
 
\entry{HMS Nelson \& Rodney}[Nelson_Rodney.png]
{40\% chance to fire a special barrage when firing main gun.}

{If you like the idea of Monitors but hate seeing them die like flies. More expensive, but also tougher to crack.}

{"BBVs suck", they said. "We'll just keep them pre-Kai", they said.}
{Hyuuga was amazing before her Kai, and she still is in new and exciting ways after it --- her FP buffs are intact and more valuable (on herself) than ever, owing to her horrifying 175\% Efficiency on her Main Guns, and while her seaplanes are the standard fare (ie. a poor excuse for a screenclear), she doesn't entirely give up her secondary guns either thanks to her special barrage.\\
Dependable, defensible and devastating --- no sucking here, just some sweet, sweet licking.}

{}
{180\% Efficiency on her Main Gun, innate +20\% Firepower and some actual planes. Jesus Christ, how horrifying.\\
Isekai lacks the support capabilties (or self-defence) of her sister, but she makes up for it by doubling down on the DPS - packing a CV/L to get some extra mileage out of her skill is advised, but not entirely necessary unless you're going on boss hunts.}

{Well, there they are, the poster vixens of Azur Lane. Distintctive in both looks and performance, they dwarf literally every other Carrier in the game with their massive amounts of Airpower and get to launch faster than anyone else, guaranteeing swift victories in PvP and one and a half extra airstrike per battle (compared to other CVs).\\
As is customary for IJN sister ships, they only shine when used together - but even when taken on their own, it cannot be understated how valuable that early launch is.}
 
 
\newpage
\subsection{Tier 1}
\entry{USS Essex}[Essex.png]
{Upon airstrike launch, launches a tight horizontal line of eight additional TBDs armed with parallel, Flooding-inflicting torps, and passively deals +10\% damage vs BBs; Increases her own AA and Airpower by 5\% for every USS CV/L in the fleet, and increases her own Airpower by 3\% whenever her planes shoot down an enemy aircraft (to a maximum of +15\% Airpower); If the fleet contains 4 or more USS ships, the entire fleet has a 12\% chance to reduce incoming aircraft torpedo and bomb damage to 1.\\
\textbf{Loadout:} 3/3/2}
{}
{Essex is the US answer to the IJN's fluffy sky overlords.\\
Boasting a statline rivaled only by that of Enterprise, graced by even more Efficient planes (especially her 140\% Fighters), armed to the teeth with skills further boosting that statline, a squadron of DoT-inflicting torpedo bombers and a fleet-wide chance to outright negate incoming aircraft damage, she is meant to give even the Foxes (or W12's plane swarms) pause for thought --- and manages to do so with gusto.\\
What keeps her from true greatness is how strictly she enforces a specific compositon for your backline to make the most of her skills - US carriers only might not be a bad thing per se, but it severely limits your choices. Her second skill being susceptible to killsteals by allied carriers or AA, and her third skill being nigh-on useless in PvE, doesn't help matters either.\\
All that said, when she's good, she's REALLY good.}

{Also referred to as RNGer for obvious reasons, and infamous because of her potentially infinite damage, you need luck on your side to get the most out of her; even without the procs, though, very few carriers get close to the sheer damage output she can unleash thanks to her 8 sea-attacking planes and high Efficiencies, and none of them can manage it at her rock-bottom 9 Oil cost.\\
Beware her near-total lack of anti-air presence, though; without Fighters or AA guns to speak of, there's little she can do about enemy planes.}

\entry{USS Yorktown}[Yorktown.png]
{Once per battle, if Yorktown's HP falls below 20\% she heals herself by 25\%; Upon receiving damage and on a 20s cooldown, launches three special SBD dive bombers (x1 2000lb, x2 100lb); Upon airstrike launch, increases frontline Damage by 15\% for 8s.\\

{Putting the 'fleet' in 'fleet carrier'}

\textbf{Loadout:} 2/6/0}
{Puella Magi Toga Magica}
{Saratoga's Kai doesn't significantly change her playstyle: she's still the powerful DB-focused CV she's always been, but with a considerably improved statline that further emphasises her strengths. Extremely solid, even from a HP standpoint.\\
Her Kai skill, just like her gunfire skill, is best regarded as a bit of free additional damage than a reliable contribution to the fight --- the extra planes have aimed torpedoes and the DoTs they inflict are fairly weak, but it's still better than most CV do in their downtime.}

Backline could use some buffs? Whether it's carriers or battleships, she's got them (and herself) covered. \\
Enemy ships are zipping around too much for your liking? Her Swordfishes inflict Slow, so they can have fun with that.\\
Subs? Don't let her stats fool you, she's still a CVL and that means she can bomb them with impunity (and great effect at that).\\
All that said, what's stopping her from true greatness is also her entire point - as a generalist, she'll never do any of these jobs better than a unit specialising in any of them, but don't let that stop you from using her.

A misnomer to say the least. See here why ---> \url{https://pastebin.com/RucY4TwC}

TLDR; not only they do contribute little to nothing to the fight, unlike Unicorn/Shouhou/Arizona, but the healing they provide is much lower than that of Unicorn/Shouhou/Arizona as soon as you start using multiple ships, even DDs.
